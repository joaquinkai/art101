					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The main issue I had with this lab was getting all the variables to print out cleanly on my site. 
						Initially the font was different and I had to think for a while about which css file and which 
						id to change in order for it to share the same font as the rest of my page. 
						I used the “output” div that housed my script tag and changed the font-family to the one I needed. 
						I also wanted to output my ownIt variable in a way that said “yes” if the boolean was true and “no” 
						if it was false. I used an inline if statement to do this which was a nice way of displaying the same 
						information in a more readable way. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think the extra effort I added to make everything look nice was where I got the most learning from. 
						Doing research about css formatting and javascript functions illuminated the possibilities of what I 
						could do with my site. The fluid nature of a javascript influenced text box is pretty exciting on its own!</p>
