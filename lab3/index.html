			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this lab was to get comfortable with linking and managin different files within my local file structure.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenges</h2>
					<p>The main challenges I had were understanding the way my two css files worked and overwrote each other.<br>
					I didn't realize you could have multiple over-arching css files, but it is quite useful.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The problems I encountered were that I was incorrectly trying to link my "index.html" files on my homepage <br>
					by calling them directly by name instead of through their directories. I realized soon after that all index files are<br>
				named the same so I had to be more specific.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I think this lab helped me understand my own computers organizational system which is a valuable skill to have. <br>
					I really enjoyed trying to make my homepage look as aesthetically pleasing as I could within my abilites but I <br>
				realized how hard it is to make everything fit nicely. </p>
